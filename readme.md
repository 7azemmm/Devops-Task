## üìù Summary

It was a pleasure to work on this DevOps task. I successfully completed the first three parts and made significant progress on the final part related to Kubernetes. Although I researched Kubernetes thoroughly and prepared the deployment script, I was unable to get it fully working due to time constraints.

## ‚úÖ Part 1: Dockerization & CI
I containerized the application by writing a Dockerfile and implemented a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the continuous integration of the Docker image..


```bash
from node:18 

workdir /app

copy package*.json ./
run npm install 

copy . . 

expose 4000 

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]


```


```bash
name: CI - Build and Push Docker Image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRYUSERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRYPASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and Push Docker Image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: hazemmohamed2002/myapp:latest
```

## ‚úÖ Part 2: Ec2 and Ansible PlayBooks
![Ec2Instance](./images/ec2-instance.PNG)

```bash
[aws_vm]
44.212.0.27 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=devops90.pem
```

```bash
- name: Install Docker on AWS EC2 instance
  hosts: aws_vm

  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install required packages

      service:

        enabled: yes
```
# run ansible playbook to install docker remotely on Ec2
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini docker-setup.yml
```

## ‚úÖ Part 3: Deploy the app using docker compose and watchtower for monitor running containers
```bash
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: hazemmohamed2002/myapp:latest
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:4000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    restart: always

  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    command: --cleanup --interval 60
    restart: always
```
